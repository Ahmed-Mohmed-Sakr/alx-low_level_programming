##Dynamic libraries

- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etcâ€¦ is forbidden

- 0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life mandatory Create the dynamic library libdynamic.so containing all the functions

- 1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future mandatory Create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
